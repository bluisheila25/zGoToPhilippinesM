It is a conical karst hills which is similar to those limestones regions of Slovenia, Croatia, Northern Puerto Rico and Cuba. These hills consist of Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene, thin to medium bedded, sandy to rubbly marinelimestones. These limestones contain the abundant fossils of shallow marine foraminifera, coral, mollusks, and algae. However, until now geologist do not have a concrete research on how they were formed. But as of now the theory they have is that they are the weathered formations of a kind marine limestone on top of an impermeable layer of clay.
