It also serves the northern and central regions of Luzon, and being 85 kilometers (50 miles) from the older Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) that serves Manila; DMIA also serves Metro Manila and its immediate vicinity. It is located on an area of the economic zone formerly utilized as the Clark Air Base, which was closed in late 1991 by the U.S. Air Forces after the explosion of Mount Pinatubo. The airport is managed by the Clark International Airport Corporation (CIAC), a government-owned and/or controlled corporation. DMIA have two (2) runways in parallel configuration. The primary runway (Runway 02R/20L) has a length of 3,200 meters and a width of 60 meters. It is fully equipped with all navigational aids and lighting facilities and has a Category 1 rating for precision approach. The secondary runway (Runway 02L/20R) has a length of 3,200 meters and a width of 45 meters. It is not yet equipped with navigational aids and lighting facilities and is currently used for Visual Flight Rules (VFR) only.<span style="font-size:32px; text-align:center; display:block" align="center"><br/>How to reach Angeles</span><br/>DMIA-NAIA Link - Diosdado Macapagal International Airport connects from Angeles City to Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila via North Luzon Expressway-EDSA-Airport Road link. By private car, it takes about 2-3 hours including traffic to reach NAIA from DMIA. The Subic-Clark-Tarlac - Expressway (SCTEx) provides access to Clark Special Economic Zone (CSEZ), including the Diosdado Macapagal International Airport, through two exits. The Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA) opened Panday Pira Road on December 23, 2008, and it is connected to the Clark North interchange in Mabalacat, Pampanga, where it leads straight to CSEZ on the left and Sacobia in Bamban town to the right. The Clark South interchange leads directly to the airport, Angeles, Tarlac, and the Subic Bay Freeport Zone. North Luzon Railway - Construction has begun on a new US$421 million North Luzon project (initiated by the Philippine National Railways), originally scheduled for completion in 2010. Two separate lines will be constructed, one for the Airport Railway, and another for the NorthRail commuter and high speed rail line serving Metro Manila and the northern Luzon provinces. Bus - There are regular bus services to various destinations from the airport, charging from PH?300 ($7.00) for Cubao (Quezon City), Mariveles, and Avenida (Manila), to PH?350 ($8.20) for SM Megamall, Pasay City and Baguio City.

Kennon Road road is the fastest route to Baguio but is the most dangerous with frequent landslides during the rainy season. Marcos Highway and Naguilian Highway are more roundabout routes but are much safer than Kennon Road and are the only routes permitted to buses and trucks.Buses leave Manila from each of the bus companies own depot. Unfortunately Manila does not have one central bus station. It will take you roughly 6 - 7 hours to travel the 250 odd kilometers from Manila to Baguio City. Bus timetables vary between the different bus companies. Schedules are fairly constant between 5:00 am and 6:00 pm. You can catch buses later than 6:00 pm as some buses leave around midnight so that you arrive in Baguio in the early morning. <span style="font-size:32px; text-align:center; display:block" align="center"><br/>Private Vehicle</span><br/> Traveling to Baguio City by road from Manila is fairly straight forward; the adventure begins when you get to the base of the Cordillera Mountains. <span style="font-size:32px; text-align:center; display:block" align="center"><br/>Kennon Road</span><br/>This is the quickest route of going to Baguio. It connects with the town of Rosario in La Union. Kennon Road was named after US Army Colonel Lyman Kennon. He was the last builder on the project and completed the road in 1903. This splendidly scenic route passes by cascading waterfalls and lush mountain vegetation. Hazards encountered include sharp blind corners, other drivers, weather including fog. On a clear day it is without any doubt a spectacular journey, with some fantastic photo opportunities.<span style="font-size:32px; text-align:center; display:block" align="center"><br/>Naguilian Road</span><br/>This road acts as a more comfortable route for the transportation of agricultural products, mined natural resources and other raw products coming out of the Cordillera Administrative Region. Worth remembering is that if you do opt to take this route it will add an additional three hours to your journey. However if you are connecting via Bauang in La Union, this may be a more convenient route.<span style="font-size:32px; text-align:center; display:block" align="center"><br/>Marcos Highway</span><br/>The Marcos Highway is the easiest route of the lot. The road is well maintained and easy to navigate. The hairpin bends and blind corners of Kennon Road are non existent. You can access Marcos Highway at the same point as Kennon Road in Rosario La Union; you can also connect at Agoo in La Union.</p>

Get to swim in pristine white sand beaches, get to view over 1,000 endangered reptiles, get to see enchanting coves and get to enjoy a drift dive and the depths of the ocean- these are enough reasons to visit and stay in Puerto Galera. <span style="font-size:32px; text-align:center; display:block" align="center"><br/>How to reach Puerto Galera </span><br/>To get to Puerto Galera from Manila you can get a bus to the Port of Batangas (about 2 hour trip). Almost all major bus lines in Manila have regular trips going to the Port of Batangas. From the port, the fastest way to any beach in Puerto Galera is to take a "banca" ride (outrigger boat) directly to your beach of choice. They leave the port several times a day starting at 7am (more often during peak season -the schedules change depending on the demand). There is also the "Ro-Ro" (roll on-roll off) ferryboat (2 1/2 hours trip) that leaves at noon. The Ro-Ro can accommodate cars. It docks on the Puerto Gallera pier. It leaves only once a day. You then have to take a jeepney or tricycle ride to your choice of beach. So if you are not afraid of small boats, take the "banca" direct from the Port of Batangas to your choice of beach at Puerto Galera.

Go all the way to the Dinalupihan junction, and turn right at the Crossroads where Soldiers pose the "Bataan Death March". Go straight and stay on the left side when you see the Shell Station splitting the road to two. Turn left into the SBMA Bataan gate. Taking this route will save you 30 minutes of travel time to the north of Zambales, and gives you a view of SBMA. Exit through the Subic gate, and turn left. Getting lost should never be a concern because Zambales has only one highway all the way up to the North, crossing all towns. If the feeling of being lost does indeed creep up, you may ask any town municipal usually found in the center plaza of all towns.There are about a handful of new GOVIC Highways newly built almost all towns of Zambales. You may take them if you are trying to cut across town proper as shortcuts.The Subic GOVIC is not yet fully complete. The castillejos GOVIC Highway is great. You turn right into this Highway at the side before the Jesus Magsaysay Highschool and exit past the town center. The San Antonio GOVIC Highway is complete already but still too dark at night. The GOVIC Highway in Iba helps you get faster into the beach area of Iba without having to chase Tricycles off the roads. <span style="font-size:32px; text-align:center; display:block" align="center"><br/>By Bus</span><br/>Take the Victory Liner (http://www.victoryliner.com) to Iba. Air conditioned and non-air conditioned buses are available. These buses will pass all the towns leading to Iba, take the Iba bus, and change buses in the Olongapo Victory Liner Terminal, and take the bus that leads to Alominos, Pangasinan. This will stop in Sta. Cruz, and other Zambales destinations farther north than Iba. From a town to another, you may take jeepney rides. Fare rates are low.<span style="font-size:32px; text-align:center; display:block" align="center"><br/>By Air</span><br/>You may rent private planes, jets, and choppers at the Domestic Airport in Paranaque at Subic Air to land in three places in Zambales. There is an International Subis Airport, A Castillejos Airstrip, and the Iba Local Airport. Best to fly daytime 6:00 a.m., or 6:00 p.m.<span style="font-size:32px; text-align:center; display:block" align="center"><br/>By Ferry</span><br/>Take the ferry ride to Subic near Manila Hotel, situated along Manila's Roxas Boulevard. Upon arrival, take the SBMA shuttle to any gate, and take the jeepney ride to the Victory Liner Terminal in Olongapo. From here, the Victory Liner may be taken to Iba or Alaminos.<span style="font-size:32px; text-align:center; display:block" align="center"><br/>HOW TO GO TO SUBIC/ZAMBALES VIA SUBIC-CLARK-TARLAC EXPRESSWAY (SCTex)</span><br/>Motorists coming from NLEX bound for Subic are advised to take the Spur/NLE interchange located between the Dau and Sta. Ines Exits of the NLEX and proceed to the SCTEx Clark Logistics Toll Plaza. After crossing the bridge, follow the loop of the ramp towards Subic. Likewise, motorists at SCTEx bound for Bataan may exit at the Dinalupihan Interchange via the Roman Highway. When in Subic Freeport, take the Kalaklan Gate to proceed to Zambales. There are two interchanges in Mabiga and Dolores, Mabalacat, Pampanga via MacArthur Hwy. on your way to Subic or Tarlac. On the other hand, motorists from Subic and Bataan bound for Manila are advised to enter the SCTEx through the Tipo Toll Plaza or the Dinalupihan Toll Plaza respectively, and follow the road signage towards the Clark Logistics Toll Plaza. Upon reaching the Clark Logistics interchange, take the first ramp to the right that will lead to the toll plaza, then the Spur/NLE interchange connecting to the NLEX. Travel time from Clark to Subic is only 40 minutes. From NLEX in Balintawak to Subic, travel time is only 1 ½ hours. <br/><br/>SCTEx HOTLINE: (02) 3-5000/(02) 362-9997/362-2246/(045) 865-2030</p>
